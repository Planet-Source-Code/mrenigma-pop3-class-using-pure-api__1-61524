## POP3 Class using Pure API


</div>

### Description

*** New Version *** - I have greately enhanced and updated this class already and it now uses pure API for the Sockets RETR Progress is included and I believe the API sockets are quick , Progress Event is included for downloading a message.

I have looked on PSC and found many examples of POP3 code but could find none that was tidy or easy to understand. I have decided to produce my own and I am sharing it with others. It includes the APOP Authentication login and is well commented (for me anyhow). It includes a class for an Email header I put together to allow easy access to the header elements of a message, check the example app (nothing special), I plan produce a SMTP class soon too. Please enjoy
